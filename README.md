Welcome to my simple daily planner application.

This application is likely to serve anyone who is in need of tracking their plans throughout the day without worry of forgetting what one might have to accomplish.

When you open the app intitially, you will see that there is no information stored within the hourly columns.

As user fills out their duties in each corresponding hour column, they must hit save in order for this information to store otherwise they will forget what they have to do that day as nothing will save. Whoops.

Once the user hits save they will be able to close the application and reopen it or refresh it and see that they have thier duties stored within the page so that they can go about accomplish their days.

Thank you.
